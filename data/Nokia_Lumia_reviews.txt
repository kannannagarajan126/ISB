I have had iPhones, where the user interface is just so boring, even with all those apps that cost you money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nokia has wonderful Nokia apps already installed, such as Nokia Drive, which gives you directions while you are driving with a talking attendant, it is super accurate and fun to use.  You get Nokia Music, which is a free music service with 1500 playlists put together by expert music people, very good and it&#39;s free!  You get ESPN, Nokia City Lens, which is where you hold your camera up while you are walking a city street and it will give you information about the area and what you are pointing at, it is really cool.  And there are other free Nokia apps as well, like Camera Extras, that let you do things like take action shots and panorama photos. There&#39;s a Six Flags app, PGA Tour, Contacts Transfer, The Caddie +, Univision, Groupon, Soundtracker that connects you to Internet Radio for free, let&#39;s you get concert tickets, look at lyrics, share comments with your friends on their music, et.  There&#39;s Counters, that keeps track of calls and data usuage, Creative Studio, which is a photo editing app, and so much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Windows Phone, you will have 7GB of Free Cloud Storage (which is the most for any Cloud Storage offered) for all your files and music and apps on Sky Drive, with the option to upgrade at a cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The camera takes great pictures with the Carl Zeiss lense and there are ways to adjust you settings. The phone takes great 720p videos, which is a whole lot better than 1080p in a lesser camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Windows 7.5 user interface is super easy to use, and it is very pretty to look at.  There are a ton of apps in the MarketPlace, and the most popular ones are there, many of them are free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beutiful cyan body on this phone is a matte finish, so it doesn&#39;t show fingerprints, it is made of polycarbonate, which is the same hard plastic that eye glass frames are made.  If you were to get a deep scratch the color goes all the way through, so it won&#39;t show.  Even the USB Charger has a modern style, with it&#39;s round geometric shape outlet plug.  All in all this is one hot phone.</td>

        <td id="LC2" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">This phone is great! It&#39;s the best phone I&#39;ve ever owned. I have been a dedicated high end Android user, but I found this phone to be a much more satisfying experience than either the iPhone or the Android phones. I want an OS that will meet my current needs and have a great user interface with a good amount of apps available for me to manage my daily mobile cell phone use, and not have to make expensive phone upgrades all the time. The Nokia Lumia 900 is a very well constructed phone.The aesthetics are pleasing, it&#39;s modern and function goes well beyond my expectations. It operates very fast and smooth even though it has a single core processor and only 512MB on RAM. If you are not aware of these specs, you might think it has a multi-core processor and more RAM on board. Nokia has come up with a phone that is both pleasing in design and very efficient when it comes to performance. The screen is bright with beautiful color saturated screen, and seems to have less glare outside when it&#39;s sunny. I can actually read the screen in such conditions. This is a big plus for me! It has 16GB of ROM, which is plenty by itself, but pared with the 7GB of frees cloud storage, it&#39;s more than enough for me. I really don&#39;t know what the fuss is about concerning the number of apps available for Windows Phones. Unless you are some kind of developer or techy person, there are plenty of apps available for this phone (both from MS, Nokia and third party) for the everyday cell phone user, even business user. The game apps seems so much more refined (probably because there are a lot of Xbox games available for this phone) and they run beautifully on this phone. I travel a lot and I&#39;m really looking forward to  using this phone on my trips. I have always liked Nokia phones because of the quality build and support. When I started using a smartphone I got away from Nokia phones and started my Android experience. Now that Nokia has chosen to team up with MS to re-enter the smartphone market, I wanted to try their phones again. What a lovely surprise! I&#39;m crazy for the Lumia 900 and look forward to future offerings from Nokia, if and when I get tired of this phone or need to upgrade. I recommend this phone, it&#39;s quality at affordable prices. Great design, sturdy, fast and very easy to use, especially if you run Windows 8 on your computer. Try it! You won&#39;t be sorry. By it from Amazon, the best place to shop and that&#39;s coming from a person that doesn&#39;t or ever has worked for them. I forgot to tell you that there is an upgrade of the operating system to 7.8, which is very similar to Windows 8, available for this phone. It&#39;s very easy to install, just install Zune on your Windows computer, connect your phone to USB,  and it will find the upgrade and instruct you how to install.</td>

        <td id="LC3" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">I just bought this phone a few weeks ago and it is gorgeous. The screen just blew me away and the OS is very fast and user friendly. This is the first time I try a Windows phone and I have to say that it&#39;s been a wonderful experience. From now on I&#39;ll just use Windows phone for my daily use. My next gadget will be Nokia Lumia 920. I just can&#39;t look foward for this phone to hit the market. Nokia designs the best and most beautiful phones and now they work with the best OS on the market. Well done, Nokia and Microsoft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let&#39;s talk about Apps. I&#39;ve read many comments of people talking about the &#39;&#39;lack of app&#39;&#39; on the Marketplace. I can tell my own experience. I come from Android and also I had a Apple iPhone 4S and the only App missing on the Marketplace (talking about me and the apps I use the most) are Instagram and OVO (and I&#39;ve heard Instagram is comming soon to Windows Phones before this year ends). I have Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, MSN, KiK, Viber, Badoo, SkyDrive, Tango, Skype,Youtube,Shazam, SoundHound, Netflix, IMDb, Evernote, ESPN, CNN, Univision,SkyMap, TuneIn Radio, WhatsApp, Wikipedia and Weather much more... Also the Nokia App (Nokia Maps, Drive, City Lens, Music, Trailers, Creative Studio, Counters, Soundtracker, Transit, Contacts Transfer, Camera Extras and much more). The Marketplace keeps growing. The integration of Facebook, twitter, MSN, LinkedIn and Foursquare in my Windows Phone is AMAZING! I can put comments and give &#39;&#39;likes&#39;&#39; directly from my phone due to the AMAZING integretion between those Apps and my phone. and I don&#39;t have to go to the Facebook or Twitter App to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m totally in love with my Nokia Lumia 900 and its amazing OS! I 100% recommend it! If you wanna be different, switch and go for it! Nokia Lumia phones the amazing experience!</td>

Also when I insert the SIM, the phone displays a message requesting an unlock code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to the company and I received excellent advice to unlock the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my phone.

        <td id="LC5" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">The Nokia Lumia 900 was my first smartphone. Im a programmer, so I really appreciate how easy it is to write software for it. That being said, the phoen itself is what I&#39;m rating so lets get to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;I love the feature-rich experience and the battery life is quite good. Despite what I have read from other websites it seems fairly light to me (then again, I don&#39;t like owning a smartphone that feels like its gonna float away). The speaker is one of the loudest I have ever heard on a smartphone, and it outputs really good quality audio too! The camera takes excelent quality photos and I feel that it is quite feature-rich. The flash is extremely bright, and makes a good flashlight in a pinch. the case is so tough that I dare someone to try and break it. I have yet to scratch the phone case itself and I have had this phone for about 6 months now (I tend to drop my phone, so this is impressive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Let me first say that I DO NOT have a problem with the hardware. I have a few compaints about the software though. If you know about WP already then the rest of this section won&#39;t help you. That being said, I would dearly like to be able to make playlists on the go without the need to sync with zune software. I will also be excited when more developers get apps into the store (although all the ones I need are already there). My biggest issue right now is the OS upgrade, or rather the lack of one. WP8 came out and lumia 900 users kinda got the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;This phone is an excelent choice! The price is excelent, the calls are clear, the interface is sleek, and the phone is near indestructable. I would like to see some love from microsoft in regaurds to software upgrades, but other than that I would (and do) recomend this phone to anyone who wants a good, dependable phone.</td>

        <td id="LC6" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">I am a tmobile customer and with an unlocked Nokia 900 Lumia from ATT .Let me simply say it has to be one of the best kept secrets in smartphones. Though I knew the phone was unlocked, I had no clue it took a micros sim card, which I was not aware of and meant I had to go to a carrier and switch my sim card. Problem was solved in no time. Anyway back to this review.&lt;br /&gt; I was contemplating an Iphone purchase but I could not stand to spend upwards of 450 plus buckaroos on a phone. This cost me under 300 bucks give or take plus  a few quality accessories. SO in the budget department alone, this phone gets a gold star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read reviews there is a lack of apps....I dispute that HOWEVER, do not expect an array of exactly what you see on android play store.  There are a lot of apps for everything you need, some just not as popular. There are financial apps(Citibank, capitalone etc)missing but thats about it. With that in mind, the internet explorer is really smooth(way better than my old phone, my touch 4g slide). It has microsoft word and excel also. The interface is smooth, unbelievable this is a cool phone! One feature that is really different, the GPS navigator. Setting things up did not take long at all. You will be seduced  by the sleek look. I am not done playing around with it, but i know now I made a good choice here. I dont know where Nokia has been(I had one in the early 2000s) but I have since had a blackberry and a couple of tmobile high end phones. Nokia has made a giant leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/27/13&lt;br /&gt;After a few more days of use I feel real proud about not caving to buy the iphone. The battery life, which with mytouch 4g was ALWAYS an issue, is really impressive. You get at least a good 10 hours if you leave it on,probably longer if you leave the battery saver option on. I discovered the sky drive(similar to icloud) on Marketplace which gives you additional 7Gigs or so free, plus available upgrades for a fee and you get to store for music or other files. I really do think the only thing that will stop this phone from blowing out the competition unfortunately, are the lack of the &#39;mainstream&#39; apps. Also some apps free on Google play store(android) might not be on Marketplace(if available) But believe me unless you are one for the bandwagon, this change is worth a try, especially if the iphone or high end androids are a little above your budget.</td>

The phone is simply great. It is easy to use, with lots of features, and well built. Good Nokia quality as expected. I have always been a fan of Nokia phones and the Nokia /Microsoft combination is perfect. The touch screen is becoming easier each time. The phone is indeed unlocked and I did take it to my initial cell provider. However,I was not pleased with the speed offered by them and had to switch to another provider - Digicel in the Caribbean is now my new cell provider. What a difference and the 4G LTE speed is simply amazing. Very pleased in all areas, and the phone did not let me down. Additional update to follow if necessary as I use the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 20 Dec 12:&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the seller of my Nokia Lumia 900 unlocked cell phone was Masterdeals. My cell was indeed unlocked and I was able to communicate with them. Still very pleased with the Nokia Lumia 900 !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 14 SEPT 13:&lt;br /&gt;This phone is still working very well. I have never had an issue with it, and I will say over and over again, &quot;I really like my phone&quot;. Its fast ( good provider ), and I even read books on my phone. Its like my mini PC with easy use of the Microsoft office. I have also dropped it many times, but fortunately it was well protected. Lots of apps, and I am able to track my morning run/walk without a glitch. Unfortunately windows phones are missing the app for Magic Jack, and that is the only important app that I am lacking. Waiting on Magic jack to create an app for Windows phones ! Love the live tiles, and like that I can organize them how I want them - reminds me of my desktop. As you use the phone, you will learn the features. Still a great phone !!!</td>

But they stil keep telling me it was a new phone. So please buy the phone but NOT from this seller - because the phone is good but service is awfull.

        <td id="LC11" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">I have been using a Blackberry Curve for the last 3 1/2 years and avoiding a smartphone because of the additional costs associated with new activations. However, I decided that it may be time to upgrade since I would like to be able to use this phone overseas on travel. I did some research - thought about going with the new Blackberry Q10 - but the outright unlocked purchase price is high and I wanted to test out an unlocked GSM phone before I went hog wild on the phone of my dreams.&lt;br /&gt;I went with the 900 because it is affordable but not too outdated yet (although the 925 AT&amp;T and 928 Verizon are already out). I read great reviews on the design and wanted to go with something other than the iPhone.&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Feel Good Sales - the product was unlocked and worked right out of the box when I took it down to T-Mobile for a SIM card. It was just as advertised - new (AT&amp;T), unlocked.&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind that there are many different vendors that sell under the same item number so you don&#39;t really know who the seller is. I chose to go with an Amazon Fulfilled seller, believing that there is a bit more consumer protection if they are responsible for the processing of the transaction. Also believing that if a seller uses Amazon to fulfill, they are probably selling what they&#39;re advertising since returns seem to be processed through Amazon also. In any case, be careful which vendor you choose and check their ratings. I read some of the reviews for other vendors (especially direct sales) that would lead me to believe that not all sellers are created equal.&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#39;s super easy to set up the Lumia 900 and I found lots of forum hints on it. The one thing that I had a problem with to start was sending and receiving MMS (pics through text). But I found a topic online that told me I needed to download the Network Setup app from Nokia and select my provider - it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Marketplace is really easy for downloading apps because I already have an Microsoft e-mail account. I am not a heavy user of apps so I don&#39;t really have much to say about them but they&#39;re there and I will probably look into them more.&lt;br /&gt;I have read lots of reviews saying the battery life is short but then so it is for the iPhone. Do your research but I think the Lumia 900 is a good choices - especially for me, as a starter smartphone that I wouldn&#39;t be afraid to take overseas. I think at some point, I might want to get a newer, international model - hopefully after they improve battery life (according to the critics).&lt;br /&gt;But in the meantime, I&#39;m thrilled!</td>

The phone is sold by various sellers with orders fulfilled by Amazon. Therefore, product reviews for this phone appear on each individual seller&#39;s product page.  If you have comments for the seller, you may or may not be able to leave the seller feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Cell-Source did advertise the Nokia Lumia 900 as a &quot;Brand New&quot; unlocked GSM phone and the phone had no noticeable defects, the product packaging needs to be improved.  The seal on the box was broken, the screen protector didn&#39;t adhere very well, the USB cable wasn&#39;t secured and the manual appeared to be used. What Cell-Source didn&#39;t advertise is that the Nokia Lumia 900 is  AT&amp;T unlocked (versus factory unlocked) with some AT&amp;T apps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you can uninstall the apps, the AT&amp;T logo is permanent.  When I turn on the phone, I see the swirl plus &quot;Rethink Possible&quot;.  However since it&#39;s unlocked, it can be used with GSM carriers other than AT&amp;T.  I use a T-Mobile SIM card and it works fine.  It&#39;s a neat phone and I&#39;m looking forward to perusing the tutorials available on the Internet to learn more.  However, I do wish I could remove all of the AT&amp;T stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the product and seller reviews, I suggest taking a look at the &quot;Customer Questions &amp; Answers&quot; section on this product page to find out more about the Nokia Lumia 900 prior to purchasing.</td>

A first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses&lt;br /&gt;There is no external memory slot (though it does have a built in 16GB memory, more than enough for my needs)&lt;br /&gt;Battery is non-removable (shame)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This phone has really impressed me and I would recommended it to anyone who needs a well built phone that is reliable, with clear calls and decent battery life!&lt;br /&gt;Is it better than an I phone? No idea, never owned one! It is better, way better than some Android phones I have owned but I am sure as good as the current  higher end Android, it just depends on your personal preferences.&lt;br /&gt;As regards &quot;APPS&quot; I found all the apps I needed, Nokia Maps is an impressive stand in for Google Maps, Bing Translater is really very impressive too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no regrets at all about switching to this phone and if you are willing to try it, I think you will like it!</td>

I went to tmobile and had my SIM card cut down for free so that was easy. I played with it all weekend and it worked great until I left my house and tried to use my data plan for internet and send pictures.. I went back to tmobile to see if they could set it up for me and they couldn&#39;t. the guy said, &quot;oh didn&#39;t anyone tell you our 4G data plans don&#39;t work on unlocked phones.&quot; And handed me back the phone. I of course found out from the tmobile website that they have a code or a series of APN and MMS codes to use, but I tried that and it still didn&#39;t work.. So now I&#39;m waiting for my job&#39;s IT guy to come back from vacation to figure this out for me.. Other wise I love the phone and I&#39;m just sending pictures if I want to by email. The camera features are great and my wifi connection is pretty fast. I can&#39;t think of anything else I&#39;ve come across other than that.. It&#39;s not the end of the world that I can&#39;t use my data plan while out and about or get any MMS messages.. I&#39;ll survive.. Hopefully my work guy can figure it out and then I&#39;ll be completely happy.</td>

The price point here is better than if I had bought it in the store I checked (you know, that US carrier that advertises it does not &quot;lock you into contracts&quot;). The phone does everything I need it to do and the features are exactly as advertised. No unpleasant surprises. My only disappointment is that this particular phone is not &quot;factory&quot; unlocked (and the sellers do not claim it is). So ATT branding is on the phone and on some of the apps. Since I use this phone overseas and am not an ATT customer, I would prefer not to have these ATT demarcations on my phone. In the past, I have been more careful to select a factory unlocked phone but overlooked that detail this time. Otherwise, the phone is easy to use and performs well, consistent with Nokia standards.</td>

        <td id="LC19" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">UPDATE: MMS function is broken. The phone can neither receive nor send images and videos via text. I&#39;ve tried troubleshooting it using every trick I could find on the internet including the official forums of Microsoft, Nokia and my career, with no result other than wasting almost an entire morning. And I am very tech-savvy (seriously, I&#39;ve hacked all my kindles so far. I use Linux. If I can&#39;t solve the problem, not many can.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deduct 2 stars from my 3-star review because this is kind of a big deal for most users. Come on MS and Nokia, how do you expect to survive against Apple and Android with a problem like this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Zune constantly causes trouble. Every time I need to connect my phone to my Win 7 pro pc, I need to troubleshoot manually from the device manager to get the PC recognize the phone. If this happened in 2004, I would understand. Back then, our standards of plug-n-play were much lower. Now, they are high and especially because THIS IS A WINDOWS PHONE CONNECTING TO A WINDOWS PC. How would the people who buy iphones feel if they connect it to their macbooks and it fails to even recognize the device? Dumb right? So, I take a star off. Still good phone for the price, but if you can afford a good android, go for it I say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this phone new on another website (woot.com, affiliate of amazon) for 199.99, it was a great bargain for the price. I would consider buying at Amazon.com&#39;s price too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Very responsive touchscreen. I can&#39;t tell the difference between the latest iphone and Lumia 900 in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;2- Light.&lt;br /&gt;3- Sleek look.&lt;br /&gt;4- Unlocked. (T-mobile doesn&#39;t list 900 on their compatible phones list but everything works including 4g)&lt;br /&gt;5- Great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Zune. To connect it to a computer you have to install Zune. Windows 7 doesn&#39;t even recognize the phone without Zune (which is ironic, because it is after all a windows phone), I don&#39;t like producers shoving down clinger-ware down my throat just because they can. The device has 16 GB memory (12 available after OS and updates). So, why the hell not install the communication protocol on it and don&#39;t make me use Zune as interface.&lt;br /&gt;2- The landscape mode is a bit glitchy. It keeps going back to the portrait mode when you enter a new contact to your phone book. You have to turn and twist it a bit to get it back to landscape.&lt;br /&gt;3- Not as many apps. Most app developers consider windows platform a dead-duck. So, if you want to use the newest apps, stick to apple or android.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In-betweens:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Camera. It works well for a phone camera but nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;2- Sound quality. Works well. Again nothing special. The speakers can get very loud, do you really want to use your phone speakers to listen to music?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Solid smart phone for the price. It is near unjustifiable to pay triple for the newest Iphone or Android machine unless you are crazy about the apps.</td>

Boots fast, decent battery life (always lasts through the day). Stable and reliable. Exclusive Nokia apps like &amp;#34;Music&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Drive&amp;#34; give the device an edge over other manufacturer&#39;s windows phones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for design, the sleek, uni-body device really stands out. The dedicated camera button can wake the phone, unlock it, and have the user snapping photos immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Integration with Skydrive works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Windows app store is kind of limited, but only if you&#39;re looking for a few specific apps. There are third-party workarounds for most popular apps. Not compatible with Windows Phone 8 apps unless the developer ports it over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camera quality is not as great as it should be. Some photos have a yellowish tint to them. This can be fixed with an auto-fix feature that&#39;s built-in to the device, but it&#39;s an extra step that seems unnecessary.</td>

The amount of apps Nokia continue to push out, along with their support, make this phone a no brainer to purchase. I&#39;ve used Android as well as iOS, and yes WP OS is really a breath of fresh air and a joy to use. I can honestly say the &amp;#34;Live Tiles&amp;#34; are addictive and you won&#39;t just put your phone up in your pocket. It(OS) makes you continue using your phone for everything possible. Anyway, enough about the OS, more about the phone. This is one of the best built phones ever! Of course you will have fans of the 800, 900 &amp; N9, all are pretty much the same with small differences(screen build and size). The color is sort of hard to explain, cause depending on where and the lighting it can look several different shades of blue, but every shade looks beautiful. When I&#39;m out and have the phone on the table or bar, never fails, a couple of people will ask about it and are simply amazed at the beautiful of the phone. Well, this was only a quick little review, I will be getting the new Lumia 920, HTC 8X, and also the HTC One X+, in the near future.</td>

I thought it must be me simply being dense. And nobody at the store knew that it couldn&#39;t be done. But that&#39;s the case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bad. I bought a Windows phone made by Nokia: the Lumia 900. Really ELEGANT. Very affordable. Sweet, except I can&#39;t read my email thru Apple on this device. It&#39;s like asking somebody for directions and being told &quot;you can&#39;t get there from here.&quot; Seriously, in this modern era, for three computer giants (Microsoft, Nokia, Apple) and a major communications company (ATT) to sell a phone which can&#39;t (won&#39;t!) receive email from a competitor is dumbfounding. There oughta be a law!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being told the situation by the very patient, intelligent, lovely people who persistently tried to help me at the store, I came home and called ATT just to verify that this disconnect was fact. The kind lady in phone support put me on hold and soon came back to tell me that, indeed, this was a definitive finding. And it holds for the 920, 925 and 1020 models, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further research would seem to suggest that Apple is the fly in the ointment. So I&#39;ve hit upon a solution. I will become my own email host. As I already own a domain name for my WordPress blog, thru Godaddy, I will begin using it as my primary email account, phasing out Apple. Hey, buying a Windows phone was a step away from being monopolized, and now Apple has pushed me one more down the path. NB: I revised this review from one star to five after some deep reflection, pain, and clarity. I had bailed on gmail a year and a half ago; and now I&#39;m bailing on iCloud. Don&#39;t do evil.

In the middle of the text battle my phone screen froze.  I had to turn off the phone and reboot. As a devote PC user we are all used to that. She laughed but I had a slighted chuckle as we discussed the bills. I have greater freedom and control of cost because I can switch carriers since my affordable smartphone is not tethered to one carrier she can not.

I have downloaded updated and turn myself inside out trying to figure out what am I doing wrong.  This phone although stating unlock can not be used to almost any but talk text and music storage without AT&amp;T.  I left AT&amp;T because they are so expensive and in Chicago calls are dropped constantly I did not want to go back but here I am crawling back to AT&amp;T buying a more expensive and limited data plan just to make this stupid phone work.

Most phones, you are stuck with whatever apps they load for you and you can&#39;t get rid of them. Not a problem on this phone. Also, this was my first experience with an on-screen keyboard.  I have always stuck with phones with a full QWERTY keyboard for texting because I hated how small the keys are on-screen, but this one is perfectly spaced and large enough so I dont make typos!  Oh, and when I do make a typo (especially in texting) it has spell-check AND auto-corrects some of the words for me!!  Phone is very easy to navigate and works great!! I love it!!</td>

        <td id="LC33" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">I want to love this phone because there is a lot to love.  But, two things have me very frustrated.  The first is that in the picture it did not indicate a carrier- but when I got the phone it is for AT&amp;T and it has a ton of their stuff on there (I am a T-Mobile customer).  I cannot send pictures via text and  think this is an incompatibility issue with T-Mobile and the phone being programmed for AT&amp;T.  As you can probably tell, I&#39;m not a techie.  I get nervous when I want to use the navigation app, for example, and it comes up talking about AT&amp;T&#39;s data plan.  If I use it, am I going to get charged for something even though I have a data plan with T-Mobile since it&#39;s an AT&amp;T app?  I also have trouble getting my emails, at times, but not always.  Don&#39;t know what that&#39;s about.  It will frequently say it is having difficulty getting a Wi-Fi connection- never had this problem with my last cheap (but T-Mobile) phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have googled the texting pictures issue and clearly I am not the only one having this issue.  However, the &quot;fixes&quot; some techies identified have not worked for me- or some others who were having the same problem.  My son also got an unlocked Lumia (710 vs. my 900) and he can&#39;t text pics either.  He spent hours on the phone with Nokia but they couldn&#39;t figure it out.  The T-Mobile people gave him a new sim card but said if that didn&#39;t work, it&#39;s a phone (Nokia) issue not a service issue.  His new phone also doesn&#39;t get incoming calls (they go straight to v/m) although he gets regular texts and can make calls.  Nokia couldn&#39;t figure that one out either.  My other son, however, got an unlocked Nokia (also a 710) but it has the T-Mobile logo on it- he doesn&#39;t have any of these problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now, I don&#39;t know if I should return it or keep it.  I know I will end up costing me to return it.  And it&#39;s a beautiful phone in every other way.  I really love a lot of it&#39;s features.  But, I would never buy another unlocked phone unless it has the T-Mobile logo on it (and they seem to be hard to come by.  Probably will get harder now that they don&#39;t have contract any more).  Just be wary...</td>

Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. Lumia 900 has been succeeded by Nokia Lumia 920.  For someone interested in a first smartphone which doesn&#39;t break the purse, Lumia 900 is an excellent choice. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lumia 900 has 4.3&quot; (109 mm) 800x480 resolution 217 ppi 16m compared to the Lumia 920 which has a 4.5&quot; IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 16 GB storage and 512 MB RAM compared to Lumia 920 which has 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  Lumia 900 has 8 MP camera and 720 p video compared to Lumia 920 which has a 8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.4 GHz Qualcomm Scorpion processor compared to Lumia 920 which has a 1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass  compared to Lumia 920 which has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning&#39;s Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of &quot;armor,&quot; making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are &quot;stuffed&quot; into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see Lumia 920 has, what I would say incremental upgrades over 900 but nothing earth shattering. Lumia 900  as well as 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 1830 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 900 as well as 920 doesn&#39;t have a removable battery cover, which means you can&#39;t access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic.  Lumia 900 has Bluetooth 2.1, whereas  Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TO52A2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk&quot;&gt;Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AIRUOI8/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk&quot;&gt;JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black&lt;/a&gt;  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lumia 900 has the diagnostic tool. It can be obtained by pressing ##634# on the dial keypad, which should initiate the download after the last # is pressed. The diagnostic tool should appear on the app list under Diagnostics.On this diagnostic tool one can run tests on the following: Accelerometer, ALS, audio loopback, camera, battery status, DTMF, gyroscope, hardware buttons, headset detection, LCD white, lights, life timer, magnetometer, power source, proximity, speaker, touch and vibration. It&#39;s also possible to perform all the tests in one run. This is really cool to have this power at the user&#39;s hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don&#39;t have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 900 is certainly the best and cheapest Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market, it was really the best in 2012, but if you don&#39;t mind the budget get the 920 or 820 (for microSD card slot).</td>

The software is great. The marketplace had almost every app I needed and more. It had whatsupp, viber, facebook, kik. The x-box live feature was good.

        <td id="LC62" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">I got my Nokia Lumia 920 from AT&amp;T 1 month ago exactly, and today it turned itself off. I&#39;ve been unable to get it to turn back on. The folks at AT&amp;T were also unable to help me turn it back on, so they&#39;re mailing me a new one. But if I could have my way, I would trade it in for an Android. The camera on this thing is excellent, no doubt about that, but most apps are developed only for Android or iPhone. I can&#39;t get many of my favorite apps on this, so it definitely left me wanting. Games that were free on my Samsung cost $1.99 on a Nokia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY TO REPLACE THE BATTERY ON THIS THING. I want everyone to be aware of that. Though I hear that most of the newer phones are heading in that direction. Manufacturers are starting to get greedy. Now when the battery dies, we can&#39;t just go out and buy a new battery. The entire phone will have to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s big and clumsy. I miss my Samsung. The call clarity is great, the OS is good, and it links up very well with hotmail (all of my camera pics were on my SkyDrive, even though I didn&#39;t put them there). I just feel like all these perks would also have come with a Samsung. That&#39;s it.</td>

First, I do not think it is new because it was not in original packaging. It was in a Lumia 900 box, but the phone was not secure in it, just kind of banging around inside. It did not come with headphones, and the manual looked photocopied, so that was not original either. So if you think you will get something like if you bought it at the store, you won&#39;t. Anyway, I&#39;ve been using the phone for about 2 weeks now, and it seems to be fine. It actually is unlocked. I am using it with Straight Talk. The description is wrong in that it does NOT have a microSD slot. It has 16GB internal memory ONLY. There is no slot for a microSD. The phone itself is working fine though, and I am happy with it. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but I really wanted a Lumia 900 so I took the chance. So far, so good. My seller was DealInABox, I think it was. I gave 4 stars instead of 5, because it did not come with headphones and it seems to be used or refurbished and it had already been unboxed, as indicated by the phone just banging around inside the box and not being secure, as well as the photocopied manual, and missing headphones. I would rather have had a new one like the description said, but for only 300 dollars AND unlocked, I won&#39;t complain too much about it. So far, I am happy with my purchase.</td>

Other than that, after going through two updates via pc (no over the air update available), it&#39;s smooth, fast, and awesome.  However, I don&#39;t know why Zune music is displayed instead of Xbox music even after updating the phone.  Because of this , I can&#39;t use xbox music pass.  Other than that, 16gb is plenty, (I had problems with LG L9 because it came with only 4GB, hard to install apps).  No microSD though.  I refuse to pay $700 for a phone. This is perfect.  THere are many windows apps.  I only use navigation, yelp, kindle, flixter, and audible so it&#39;s great.  Oh and the GMail is not accessible, there is no app for it, you have to go to the browser.  Bluetooth works great with my car.  I canceled Rhapsody because Rhapsody on windows phone, at least this one, is slow and lagging.  So I uploaded music tracks and the navigation for music is better than android apps I used before.  Battery life is descent too.  Phone is a lot heavier than say, LG Optimus L9 but have a stronger built feel than Lumia 521.  I returned 521 due to volume button defect and freezing. It&#39;s funny because 521 had microSD and xbox music.  Too bad button stopped working, 521 is cheaper too.  But anyway I like this phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: It came in AT&amp;T packaging even though it advertised as Unlocked GSM.  Phone also has AT&amp;T logo on it.  I am under TMobile.  Anyway it works and I like windows better than android in terms of getting rid of default network provider&#39;s apps easily since I am on T Mobile.  With an android phone, this would be impossible, at least the android phones I&#39;ve used.  For example, I tried hard to get rid of at&amp;t apps on my Motorola phone when I switched to TMobile but I couldn&#39;t.</td>

        <td id="LC80" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">I&#39;ve had the Nokia Lumina 900 for about a year and have not had a positive experience.  I initially purchased it through Best Buy for a two year AT&amp;T contract.  I had multiple Nokia phones in the past (the awesome indestructible Meme ones) and was really excited about this phone because it was my first smart phone and I did not want an iPhone.  Long story short, this phone looks nice, but it has given me nothing but problems.  About two weeks ago I woke up one morning to it being worse than ever.  I have not dropped it or done anything to break it.  There is no visible external damage but the issues that it has are significant (detailed below).  I went into Best Buy and they told me to contact Nokia.  I contacted Nokia and kept asking for help to get it fixed (even for a fee) and they said that there was nothing they could do - that I would need to take it to a third party repair vendor.  Right now I&#39;m looking at other phones and having to pay outside of contract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Looks sleek.  I do like the Windows UI with the tiles.  People do like it and comment on it.  Because I&#39;ve had good luck with Nokia in the past and I did like this phone initially before the issues started, I will give it two stars.&lt;br /&gt;- Size.  I&#39;ve seen many different phones and after using this phone and getting used to it, the iPhones seems to small and the Galaxys seem too big.  This one feels just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Camera: I&#39;ve compared the camera to my friend&#39;s iPhones and Galaxy pictures and I have to say I prefer their pictures more.  The Lumina 900&#39;s pictures offer less brightness and contrast and end up being darker and blurrier in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life currently ~ 2 hrs (I&#39;ve had it about a year and expected the battery to still be going strong).&lt;br /&gt;- Messaging and internet does not work (this is broken for me, so my experience may be atypical)&lt;br /&gt;- Windows OS.  It has some good points and some bad.  I do not like how they require MS Zune for updates.  Added account flexibility would also help instead of forcing Windows Live.  It comes across as Windows forcing people to use their peripheral products when I don&#39;t need it.  I don&#39;t know too many people who have a Windows Live accounts as their primary email.  I know this is the OS and not the hardware, but it does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;- Initially group texts would just be seen as a single text from one person, and if you replied it would only go to him or her and not the group.  That was frustrating for planning.&lt;br /&gt;- The Customer Support.  I emailed them with my problems and they sent canned replies each time until by the third time they just said they could not help.  I know this lack of support is common through the industry, but I still don&#39;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#39;ve had common issues of it just shutting down and glitching and sometimes missing calls since about a few months after getting it.  It got a lot worse about two weeks ago and I&#39;m not sure what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I may have just received a lemon phone, so take my review for what it is.  If you get one that works, then I&#39;d be a fine phone.  Didn&#39;t work for me and I&#39;ll probably try another manufacturer out next.</td>
